Download or clone the repo, and run the npm i in the CLI to install dependencies. Create a .env file locally and provide it with your mysql information according to the variables used in the connection.js file. Open a mysql terminal in the db folder and run a source schema.sql command to create the database. Finally, run npm seed to create some sample entries and run node server to start the server.

## Usage

Using a route tester, like insomnia, you can use various routes to affect the data in the database.
